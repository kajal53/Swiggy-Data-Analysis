🍽️ Swiggy Data Analysis Project

📌 Overview
This project analyzes over 4,000 Swiggy food delivery orders to uncover trends in customer behavior, delivery performance, and restaurant metrics.

Using Python, Pandas, and Plotly in Google Colab, I created 7 interactive visualizations to explore patterns such as order volumes, delivery times, and cancellation rates.

This project highlights my data analytics skills, including:

Data cleaning

Exploratory data analysis

Insight extraction

Interactive data visualization

🛠️ Tools Used
Python: Core programming language

Pandas: For data cleaning and analysis

Plotly: For interactive visualizations (bar, pie, line, and scatter plots)

Google Colab: Cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment
