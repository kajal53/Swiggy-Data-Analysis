# Swiggy Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy's food delivery dataset to uncover insights about restaurant performance, customer behavior, and market trends. The analysis is performed using Python for data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), with visualizations to highlight key findings.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information related to Swiggy's food delivery platform, including details about restaurants, orders, and customers. It is typically stored in a CSV or Excel file (e.g., `swiggy_data.csv`) and includes columns such as:
- Restaurant ID
- Restaurant Name
- City
- Cuisine Type
- Average Rating
- Delivery Time
- Cost for Two
- Order Details, etc.

*Note*: For detailed dataset information, refer to the dataset file or documentation within the repository.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand restaurant performance, cuisine preferences, and order patterns.
- Identify trends, such as popular cuisines, top-rated restaurants, or delivery time variations across cities.
- Create visualizations using Python (e.g., histograms, bar charts, heatmaps) to present insights.
- Provide actionable insights for stakeholders, such as restaurant owners or Swiggy's business team.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and documentation.
